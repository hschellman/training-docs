## DUNE Computing Consortium

The DUNE Computing Consortium works to establish a global computing network that will handle the massive data streams produced by distributing these across the computing grid.
Selected consortia members coordinate DUNE computing activities to new members to acquaint them with the specific and DUNE software and resources.

DUNE Computing Consortium Coordinator: Heidi Schellman (Oregon State University)

## Support

There will be live documents linked from [Indico][indico-event-link] for each [Zoom][zoom-link] session. You can write questions there, anonymously or not, and experts will reply. The chat on Zoom can quickly saturate so this is a more convenient solution and proved very successful at the previous training. We will collect all questions and release a Q&A after the event.

You can join DUNE's Slack: `dunescience.slack.com`. We created a special channel `computing_training_basics` for technical support, join [here][slack-join-link].
